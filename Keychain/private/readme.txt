Please make sure that no .asc files are stored here 
only .bin files generated from the app will be used as storing privatekey without protection is an Opsec issue

==> Encryption using Argon2 AES 
==> Make sure to remember your password or keys stored here will be unusable 
==> To add a new key you can either use the PGP vault from the CLI or add your keys (PUB/PRIV) at the root the CLI will encrypt and mouve / copy the file but will NOT delete the .asc private key so dispose of it with consideration
